1. How can I decide what depth (how many layers) to choose for my computer vision model?
2. How can I decide what width (how many channels per layer and in what image size) to choose for my computer vision model?
3. What are the impacts of using the same size filter in every layer, then a different one?
4. Does the filter remain the same across layers? What is the impact?
