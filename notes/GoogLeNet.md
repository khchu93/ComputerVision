# GoogLeNet

## Architecture

## Key Achievements
- Introduced Inception Module with learnable filters to handle multiple scales
- Used of 1 x 1 Convolution as a dimension reduction module to remove computational bottlenecks and also the depth of the networks without a significant performance penalty
- Applied Global average pooling
- Applied auxiliary classifiers for training
