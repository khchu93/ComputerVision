# Masked R-CNN

## Motivation

- At the time, CNN-based models were already good at classification, object detection, and even semantic segmentation, but they couldnâ€™t distinguish between different instances of the same class.
- To solve this, the authors proposed Mask R-CNN, extending Faster R-CNN with a mask prediction branch to enable instance segmentation.
